Design and implementation of Combinational and Sequential circuits. Number systems and boolean arithmetic, simplification of boolean functions, hardware description languages, timing analysis and implementation technologies.

Projects are developed using Intel Quartus Prime Tools Suite for FPGA Design.

Project 1: Combinational logic gates (Design Entry Methods using Quartus)

Project 2: Simpl ALU Design (VHDL for Combinational Circuits)

Project 3: Energy Monitor (VHDL for Combinational Circuits)

Project 4: Sequential Logic and State Machines (VHDL for Sequential Circuits)
